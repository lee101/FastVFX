# Video Thresholding with CUDA Acceleration

This repository contains a Cog-compatible implementation of video thresholding with CUDA acceleration. The model processes video files by applying a threshold filter and outputs the result in AV1 format using NVIDIA's hardware encoder.

## How to use

```bash
sudo cog predict -i video="https://netwrckstatic.netwrck.com/input2.mp4" -i threshold=0.5
```

## Development

```bash
virtualenv .env
source .env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## deploy

```bash
cog push
```

## Implementation Details

The predictor uses:
- TorchAudio's StreamReader for efficient video decoding
- CUDA-accelerated video processing
- NVIDIA's AV1 encoder (av1_nvenc) for high-quality compression
- RAM disk storage for faster I/O operations

## Key Features

- Hardware-accelerated video decoding with multiple codec support
- CUDA-based thresholding operation
- Efficient AV1 encoding with NVIDIA GPU
- Temporary file handling using RAM disk
- Support for various input formats:
  - MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, WEBM
  - GIF
  - FLV, F4V
  - WMV
  - M4V, 3GP
  - TS, MTS

## How to deploy

```bash
cog push
```

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add support for batch processing
- [ ] Implement more video filters
- [ ] Add progress callback
- [ ] Support CPU fallback when GPU is unavailable
- [ ] Add video preprocessing options

## Performance Considerations

The predictor is optimized for GPU execution with:
- CUDA-accelerated video decoding
- In-memory frame processing
- Hardware-accelerated AV1 encoding
- RAM disk usage for temporary files
